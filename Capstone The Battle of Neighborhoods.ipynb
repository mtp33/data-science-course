Any call request you make is composed of, we can call this base URI, which is _api.foursquare.com/v2_ and you can request data about venues, users, or tips. But, every time you make a call request, you have to pass your developer account credentials, which are your Client ID and Client Secret as well as what is called the version of the API, which is simply a date."
